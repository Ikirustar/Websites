            <h2>Haiti</h2>
            <p>On January 12, 2010, the country was hit by a devastating 7.0 earthquake, the same earthquake that claimed the life of Britney Gengel
                 and approximately 220,000 to 300,000 other people. Later that year, a horrible outbreak of deadly Cholera affected the nation. In 
                 2016, Hurricane Matthew continued the destruction as the most catastrophic caribbean storm in nearly a decade. That storm left over 
                 a million Haitians in need of assistance. Today, people are still trying to recover while poverty, political unrest and violence 
                 continue to leave Haiti in a critical state.</p>
            <br>
            Despite the government and societal challenges that Haiti has faced, we strive to forge a path for a stronger future with education, 
            leadership and technology. With the Haitian spirit of resiliency, we work everyday to bring hope for the future generations.</p>

            <h2>Brit's Academy</h2>
            <p>Brit’s Academy, originally founded in 2016 and expanded in 2019, now provides in house, quality education to all 66 of our children. 
                Going beyond the rote memorization taught in most Haitian schools, Brit’s kids participate in daily active learning experiences that
                 encourage critical thinking through our Agile Mindset pedagogy which focuses on empathy, problem solving, social emotional learning
                  and an entrepreneurial mindset.
            <br>
            With access to new technology, our kids and staff have access to a global curriculum including our speaker series “Connect, Engage, 
            Learn.” Through this new series, speakers from all over the world are able to present to our eager students; building a bridge across 
            the ocean from Haiti and resulting in phenomenal eye-opening education.
            <br>
            In addition to learning Creole, French and English, enrichment courses in the arts, music, chess and dance education are also integrated
             in the curriculum. It is with certified teachers and support staff that our children will have the tools necessary to focus on employability
              locally in Haiti and/or the ability to compete in a global arena.</p>
            
            <h2>Sustainability</h2>
            <p>Brit’s home is continuously making efforts to be more sustainable. Since 2014, 100 solar panels have powered over half of Be Like 
                Brit’s electricity needs. This energy source fuels our power, water pump, air conditioning, internet, computers, kitchen and beyond.
                 With the help of a backup generator, it also allows us to remain “off the grid” and decreases dependency on Haiti’s unreliable and
                 expensive local resource.
            <br>
            Through a terrace designed water collection and distribution process, rainwater flows through our garden while excess is captured in 
            our water cistern underground and used for our sprinkler system on drier days. Brit's Home also has a nanotechnology filtration unit 
            that is used to purify the drinking water inside the home.</p>

            <h2>Transition Program</h2>
            <p>At Be Like Brit we want to ensure the future of Brit’s kids. As our oldest children begin to transition into adolescence or young 
                adulthood we are identifying ways to continue to support and include them as part of the Be Like Brit family.
            <br>
            The pioneer transition program is designed with all of our teens in mind and aims to fully support their successful transition into 
            young adulthood with support staff, continued education, independent living, exploration of self and empowerment in the local workforce. 
            With the help of our staff and volunteers, we offer a lifelong commitment to their future and act as a guide in the next stage of their
             lives and leadership.
            <br>
            It is through this program that we will be able to continue to nurture our young adults and prepare them for their adult lives so we 
            can fulfill our goal of raising and supporting the next generation of leaders.</p>

            <h2>Health Care</h2>
            <p>Brit's Home has two nurses on staff that provide general medical care for our children, staff and their families. The 1150 square 
                foot clinic is fully operational with all the necessary tools and materials.
            <br>
            In January of 2017, Be Like Brit became an approved pre-designated Landing Zone for the Haiti Air Ambulance, enabling us to facilitate
             emergency air evacuations by helicopter in the most desperate of situations.</p>

            <h2>Community</h2>
            <p>The people of Grand Goâve have been supportive and actively involved in our efforts from the time that we first looked at the site
                 where we would later begin construction on Brit's Home. Today, Be Like Brit is the largest employer in the area, with additional 
                 employees being brought in for special projects.
            <br>
            We believe strongly that we must involve the community. Our local staff (which include social workers, caretakers, nurses and teachers)
             develop the treatment plans and curriculum for our children. Our policies and processes include our local staff and members of the local 
             community every step of the way. We have a clear appreciation for and insistence on a collaborative approach to problem solving in our 
             communities. We also offer neighboring communities our services and support wherever possible including collaboration with other schools, 
             children’s homes, missions and organizations in our area.
            <br>
            Since Brit's Home opened in 2013, when possible, we have distributed up to 1,000 gallons of purified water daily to local families. Less
             than half of the people in rural Haiti have access to clean water, and many die each year from water-borne diseases. In 2016, we 
             expanded our wells and rain-water catchment basins, with the aim of increasing our daily distribution to 2,000 gallons daily when 
             possible, serving upwards of 75 families per day. With the average household size in Haiti being approximately 6, we estimate that 
             we’re serving between 450-500 individuals each day, when offering water distribution.
            <br>
            Pre COVID, we offered medical clinics to our community. Though this is temporarily on hold, we are so grateful to all those that helped
             us make a difference and we look forward to getting back to providing medical assistance to our communities when possible.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>Since starting Be Like Brit, the safety and security of our children and staff has always been and will continue to be our top 
                priority. Haiti is in a volatile and changing state. Poverty, environmental destruction, a presidential assassination and country 
                wide chaos mean a particularly difficult time for security.
            <br>
            We are now taking extra steps to protect Brit's Home and all it represents to the future of Haiti. Be Like Brit has increased our
             security force, added a security satellite telephone system, security cameras and added a retaining security wall at our transition
              homes. In addition to our regular security staff of ten we have added three armed security guards to protect the staff and children.
               We continue to put safety first and identify the right #stepstosecurity as part of our new security campaign.</p>
