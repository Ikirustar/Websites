            <div>Britney Gengel was a beautiful and fearless 19 year old girl from Massachusetts who believed that she could change the world. She 
                protected the underdog, was a voice for those who didn’t have one and knew how to enjoy life. She’ll be remembered for how she could 
                light up a room, bring people together, help the less fortunate and live life to the fullest. She was a beautiful soul, compassionate, 
                intelligent, trustworthy and loving. She believed in and unconditionally loved the children of Haiti during her last days on earth and 
                she was determined to help the kids of Haiti. Her last wish was to start an orphanage and that’s why the Gengel Family decided to start
                the Be Like Brit Foundation.</div>
