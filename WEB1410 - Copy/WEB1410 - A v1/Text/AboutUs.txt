Who Was Brit?

Britney Gengel was a beautiful and fearless 19 year old girl from Massachusetts who believed that she could change the world. She protected the underdog, was a voice for those who didn’t have one and knew how to enjoy life. She’ll be remembered for how she could light up a room, bring people together, help the less fortunate and live life to the fullest. She was a beautiful soul, compassionate, intelligent, trustworthy and loving. She believed in and unconditionally loved the children of Haiti during her last days on earth and she was determined to help the kids of Haiti. Her last wish was to start an orphanage and that’s why the Gengel Family decided to start the Be Like Brit Foundation.

Our Mission

Our commitment is to continue the compassion of Britney Gengel by serving the children of Haiti through sustaining a safe, nurturing home rooted in the virtues of Faith, Hope and Love while developing a sense of social responsibility, community involvement and unconditional love.

Our Vision

To raise the next generation of leaders in Haiti.
