          Ruff Tales Rescue is an entirely volunteer-run organization.
          Everything we are able to accomplish is due to the devotion and
          unwavering support of our volunteers. There are numerous ways to show
          your support and volunteer for Ruff Tales Rescue!

          <p>
            We receive adoption and foster applications daily. We are always
            looking for more volunteers to help process these applications. The
            process includes calling 2 personal references, their vet if they
            have pets or have had pets in the past 10 years, and the landlord if
            they rent/condo association if they own a condo. We provide a
            processing form with a list of questions to ask and a guide to
            answer any questions you may have. This is not very time consuming,
            but it's so very important!

          <p class="home_description">
            We complete a home visit for each applicant. We provide a form with
            the things you'll want to ask/address with a potential adopter or
            foster family. Typically, a home visits takes 15-30 minutes and is a
            critical part of our adoption and foster processes. We are always
            looking for volunteers in MA, NH, CT and RI.

          <p>
            We schedule adoption events every weekend except for holiday
            weekends. Our events rotate between MA, NH & RI; we need volunteers
            to transport dogs to & from events; dog handlers who will 'study up'
            on the dog they are representing in order to answer basic questions
            about that dog; and volunteers to take pictures or our dogs at
            events for their Facebook albums and our website.

            We always need help transporting our pups! From the quarantine
            facilities to their foster families, to adoption events where many
            of our pups meet their forever families, or to their vet
            appointments! Help is needed all throughout New England. Miles are
            tax-deductible and you get a chance to hang out with our amazing
            dogs!
