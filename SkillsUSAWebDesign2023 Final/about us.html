          Ruff Tales Rescue is a dog rescue operating in Massachusetts, New
          Hampshire, Connecticut and Rhode Island that is dedicated to saving
          the lives of abandoned dogs and redirecting them to stable, loving
          environments that serve as their forever home or the bridge to their
          forever home.

        <p>
          We strive to be ambassadors for all breeds and to make excellent
          matches for our fosters, adopters, and dogs. We also educate the
          community on the importance of responsible pet ownership and proper
          care.

        <p>
          We are a 501(c)(3) no-kill dog rescue based in New England. We rescue
          abandoned, abused and often neglected dogs from states with
          significant overpopulation issues and work tirelessly to place them in
          loving, responsible homes. RTR is committed to dogs of all ages,
          breeds and those who may have pre-existing medical conditions.

        <p>
          We are not a shelter and do not have a physical facility. Instead, we
          rely on devoted foster families who open their hearts and homes to our
          dogs on a temporary basis. Foster families are the backbone of our
          lifesaving work and we support them in all aspects from medical care
          to training to supplies. We are truly a community of committed dog
          lovers.

          RTR is a completely volunteer run organization. With no paid
          employees, our volunteers come together to make a difference in the
          lives of our dogs every day. Everything we are able to accomplish is
          attributable to the unending devotion and hard work of our volunteers.
