FOSTER A DOG AND SAVE A LIFE
Help Us Make a Difference

Each year, approximately 1.2 million dogs are euthanized in the United States. Every day, simply providing short-term shelter, food, and love could save thousands of dogs. Ruff Tales Rescue is trying to decrease these numbers, but we need your help.

Our Team Rescues a Dog from the Shelter
Our team rescues dogs from high-kill shelters in Arkansas and Texas. We move them straight to a foster home where they live with a family - no more kennels! They are cared for while they receive veterinary care, such as vaccinations, spay/neuter surgery, and examinations. Once they receive a health certificate they transport to New England!

Pick Your Foster
Once the dogs are ready to transport to New England, our fosters get information about each dog, their personality, characteristics, etc. and choose a dog to foster. The dogs immediately go to a quarantine facility for 48 hours per MA/NH law. Here they are examined by a veterinarian and receive another health certificate before they can be moved to their foster home.

Be the Bridge to Their Forever Home
The fosters get the dogs from quarantine and provide them with love and care until they are adopted! We pay for all medical expenses while they are in your care, and we are able to provide items such as crates, food, leashes, etc. Fostering can last as little as a few days to a few months, but our foster team is there to help you along the way!

READY TO HELP SAVE LIVES?
We are looking for fosters in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. We are also in need of foster homes in Arkansas and Texas.

We do require all dogs and cats in the home be spayed or neutered. Dogs must be up to date on the Rabies, DHPP, and Bordatella vaccines, while cats must be up to date on the Rabies vaccine.
