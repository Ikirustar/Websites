              Hi I'm Rozzie! I am an energetic and lovable Dobie. I've had a
              good amount of training and know several commands. I love walking
              on the leash and I listen very well! I love my people and like to
              be with my family, but I do take some time to warm up to strangers
              on my own territory. I'm very loyal to my family, especially the
              toddlers in my house, so I feel the need to go on guard when
              someone unknown is approaching them. I show my guarding tendencies
              with hackles and a scary sounding bark. However, I'm very smart
              and can be redirected. Once I know someone is not a threat, I let
              my guard down.<br /><br />

              I love to eat...snacks are the best motivator for me. I get a
              little anxious when meeting strange dogs on a leashed walk, but
              once introduced properly I get along great with familiar dogs. I
              do go to doggie daycare regularly where I love to romp around with
              all my K9 friends. I cannot wait to meet my new family!<br /><br />

            I am your typical sweet puppy. I enjoy playing and zooming around

            humans and laying in their laps for an afternoon snooze. I do t
            prefer to share my food with my other k9 friends, I mean do you like
            people picking off your plate?! I'm looking for a wonderful family
            who is ready to give me my best life! <br /><br />

            I'm a big chunk of love who loves my people and just wants to be
            near them all the time. I am a floppy, goofy boy who can put a smile
            on your face just by existing. Everything I do is cute! I'm like a
            Disney character come to life. I love chewing on bones and stuffies,
            although I may need some gentle reminders as to what's mine to chew
            and what's yours. I am FANTASTIC on a leash. I also love to
            cuddle....will you cuddle me for the rest of my days? <br /><br />

            I had a rough start to life but that has not gotten me down. I am
            very smart and very sweet! I love everyone I meet, humans and K9s
            alike. I enjoy a good romp in the yard or a snuggle on the
            couch...you name it, and I'll be there. Hurry up and submit an
            application because a wonderful girl like me won't last long.

            I am an energetic boy who is looking for an active lifestyle. In my
            free time I love to chew, chew and chew - please buy me the best of
            the best bones! A back yard is nice but I don’t like to be outside
            without my people. I would prefer to be doing things with you & I
            have plenty of energy so don’t worry about me keeping up! At the end
            of the day, save time to snuggle with me - I’m a very affectionate
            boy! I would do best with someone that is excited to continue my
            training with me. I already know “sit” “down” & “crate” but I plan
            to learn a lot more! I love people of all ages but since I get over
            excited so I would prefer a home with no small kids. Prior dog
            experience is preferred but not required. <br /><br />

            Hey there, Teddy here! I love to ride in the car and go with you
            wherever you are going. I’m not a barker but will let you know when
            someone’s coming up to the house. When I’m with my people I’m a
            happy, goofy guy. I'm currently improving my leash skills at
            training, as well as working on some other commands and skills. One
            central point of my training is my resource guarding. If you adopt
            me you'll get to meet my trainer and even get two free sessions with
            him. I may have some areas to work on, but the reality is that I’m
            just a big ole teddy bear looking for someone to love me for the
            rest of my days!

            I'm a happy boy who loves to be doted upon. I enjoy playing fetch,
            doing zoomies, chewing on dog toys, eating, and playing with other
            dogs. I can entertain myself with toys which gives my foster mom a
            good chuckle. Did I mention I love food? I already know some
            commands and respond well to my name when called. I am not a
            constant barker but I will alert you when strangers arrive. If
            you're looking for a super handsome, very loyal, loving, goofy,
            playful, and amazing guy - look no further, I'm your man!!

            Hello! In case you didn't notice by my picture, I am a beautiful
            German Shepherd/Anatolia Shepherd mix. I was quite literally a
            designer dog. The breeder abandoned my kind and gentle tempered mom
            when she was pregnant with me, probably because of her age. I love
            to play with my mom and sisters. I have my mom’s sweet demeanor. I
            walk well on a leash and behave well at the vet. I love my treats
            and will even politely stand in line to accept them instead of
            trying to snatch from my siblings. I am very intelligent so the sky
            is the ceiling with my potential training. Not all treasures come in
            small packages - I will be a big, beautiful girl, but just more of
            me to love!<br /><br />
