            Each year, approximately 1.2 million dogs are euthanized in the
            United States. Every day, simply providing short-term shelter, food,
            and love could save thousands of dogs. Ruff Tales Rescue is trying
            to decrease these numbers, but we need your help.

        <h2 class="subheading">Our Team Rescues a Dog from the Shelter</h2>
        <p>
          Our team rescues dogs from high-kill shelters in Arkansas and Texas.
          We move them straight to a foster home where they live with a family -
          no more kennels! They are cared for while they receive veterinary
          care, such as vaccinations, spay/neuter surgery, and examinations.
          Once they receive a health certificate they transport to New England!
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Pick Your Foster</h2>
        <p>
          Once the dogs are ready to transport to New England, our fosters get
          information about each dog, their personality, characteristics, etc.
          and choose a dog to foster. The dogs immediately go to a quarantine
          facility for 48 hours per MA/NH law. Here they are examined by a
          veterinarian and receive another health certificate before they can be
          moved to their foster home.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Be the Bridge to Their Forever Home</h2>
        <p>
          The fosters get the dogs from quarantine and provide them with love
          and care until they are adopted! We pay for all medical expenses while
          they are in your care, and we are able to provide items such as
          crates, food, leashes, etc. Fostering can last as little as a few days
          to a few months, but our foster team is there to help you along the
          way!
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheading">READY TO HELP SAVE LIVES?</h2>
        <p>
          We are looking for fosters in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode
          Island. We are also in need of foster homes in Arkansas and Texas.

            ><br />We do require all dogs and cats in the home be spayed or
            neutered. Dogs must be up to date on the Rabies, DHPP, and
            Bordatella vaccines, while cats must be up to date on the Rabies
            vaccine.</i
