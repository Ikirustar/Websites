ADOPTION INFORMATION
 

Our Adoption Fee is $450.

​

All of our adoptable dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on required vaccines, heartworm tested (if old enough), current on flea/tick & heartworm prevention, dewormed, and microchipped. The adoption donation also helps offset the costs associated with transport to New England, state mandated quarantine, and health certificates.  

Note: Our adoption fee only barely covers the cost for a healthy dog; many of our dogs have pre-existing medical conditions such as heartworm which cost hundreds more.

Adoptable Dogs!



Name: Rozzie
Breed: Doberman
Approximate Age: 3 years
Approximate Weight: 50 pounds
Sex: Female

Hi I'm Rozzie! I am an energetic and lovable Dobie. I've had a good amount of training and know several commands. I love walking on the leash and I listen very well! I love my people and like to be with my family, but I do take some time to warm up to strangers on my own territory. I'm very loyal to my family, especially the toddlers in my house, so I feel the need to go on guard when someone unknown is approaching them. I show my guarding tendencies with hackles and a scary sounding bark. However, I'm very smart and can be redirected. Once I know someone is not a threat, I let my guard down.

I love to eat...snacks are the best motivator for me. I get a little anxious when meeting strange dogs on a leashed walk, but once introduced properly I get along great with familiar dogs. I do go to doggie daycare regularly where I love to romp around with all my K9 friends. I cannot wait to meet my new family!

I'm like a Disney character come to life. I love chewing on bones and stuffies, although I may need some gentle reminders as to what's mine to chew and what's yours. I am FANTASTIC on a leash. I also love to cuddle....will you cuddle me for the rest of my days?

Name: Ruff
Breed: Lab Mix
Approximate Age: 1 yr
Approximate Weight: 60 pounds
Sex: Male

I am an energetic boy who is looking for an active lifestyle. In my free time I love to chew, chew and chew - please buy me the best of the best bones! A back yard is nice but I don’t like to be outside without my people. I would prefer to be doing things with you & I have plenty of energy so don’t worry about me keeping up! At the end of the day, save time to snuggle with me - I’m a very affectionate boy! I would do best with someone that is excited to continue my training with me. I already know “sit” “down” & “crate” but I plan to learn a lot more! I love people of all ages but since I get over excited so I would prefer a home with no small kids. Prior dog experience is preferred but not required.

Name: Teddy
Breed: Heeler Mix
Approximate Age: 3.5 years
Approximate Weight: 72 lbs
Sex: Male

Hey there, Teddy here! I love to ride in the car and go with you wherever you are going. I’m not a barker but will let you know when someone’s coming up to the house. When I’m with my people I’m a happy, goofy guy. I'm currently improving my leash skills at training, as well as working on some other commands and skills. One central point of my training is my resource guarding. If you adopt me you'll get to meet my trainer and even get two free sessions with him. I may have some areas to work on, but the reality is that I’m just a big ole teddy bear looking for someone to love me for the rest of my days!

Compatibility:
Dogs: Can be social, but needs to be the only dog in the home due to resource guarding
Cats: No
Kids: Unknown; 12+ preferred

Name: Mickey

Approximate Age: 2.5 yrs
Approximate Weight: 45 pounds
Sex: Male

I'm a happy boy who loves to be doted upon. I enjoy playing fetch, doing zoomies, chewing on dog toys, eating, and playing with other dogs. I can entertain myself with toys which gives my foster mom a good chuckle. Did I mention I love food? I already know some commands and respond well to my name when called. I am not a constant barker but I will alert you when strangers arrive. If you're looking for a super handsome, very loyal, loving, goofy, playful, and amazing guy - look no further, I'm your man!!

Name: Phoebe
Breed: Shepherd mix
Approximate Age: 8 months
Approximate Weight: 60 pounds
Sex: Female

Hello! In case you didn't notice by my picture, I am a beautiful German Shepherd/Anatolia Shepherd mix. I was quite literally a designer dog. The breeder abandoned my kind and gentle tempered mom when she was pregnant with me, probably because of her age. I love to play with my mom and sisters. I have my mom’s sweet demeanor. I walk well on a leash and behave well at the vet. I love my treats and will even politely stand in line to accept them instead of trying to snatch from my siblings. I am very intelligent so the sky is the ceiling with my potential training. Not all treasures come in small packages - I will be a big, beautiful girl, but just more of me to love!
