            <h2>We are problem solvers. We are the Salveo Communitas Organization.</h2> We
            are a group of successful tiny home designers and builders who have
            come together to fight homelessness with our proud veterans.<br />Salveo
            Communitas is affordable housing, not free housing. Our veterans do
            not need handouts; they need housing that is high value, offers
            community, and is sustainably priced. Sustainable means the community,
            as a whole, generates enough rental income for the homes and common
            areas to be well maintained, keeping the entire community a beautiful
            and welcoming place for all our Villagers.<br />Each self contained studio
            apartment consists of a kitchen, bathroom, sofa with built-in full
            size bed, TV, built-in shelves, and an expanding porch area.
