            <h2>Our Mission</h2>Our plans are to get commitments to support 120 Bungalows 
            at this first site. We want to create a welcoming, beautiful community for our 
            veterans where they have access to quality living spaces.
            <h2>How we Got Started</h2>
            After coming across a fellow Army Veteran at a coffee shop, Ben discovered the vetreran was homeless and had been homeless for quite
            some time. He opened up on his challenges and what led him to becoming homeless;
            Medical issues that wiped out his savings and no family, which all contributed to not being able to
            make enough to afford his own place.
            There is a shortage of affordable housing in this city and it is squeezing
            everyone out of a place to live. That's why we're passionate about creating small footprint houses that anyone can afford.
