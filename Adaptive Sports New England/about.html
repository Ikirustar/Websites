            The mission of Adaptive Sports New England is to increase
            participation in sports among New England youth and young adults who
            have visual or mobility impairments. Adaptive Sports New England is
            collaborating with many adaptive-specific and mainstream sports
            programs, adding value through our focus on raising awareness,
            increasing participation, and building capacity so that more youth
            and young adults with visual or mobility disabilities can access
            sports closer to home. Adaptive Sports New England is recognized as
            tax exempt under Section 501.c.3 of the Internal Revenue Code.
