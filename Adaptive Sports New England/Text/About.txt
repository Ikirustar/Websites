Our past and current partners include South Shore YMCA, Boys & Girls Clubs of Boston, Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association, Eastern College Athletic Conference, NCAA, and the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee.

SPORT CONCIERGE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
Through our free Sport Concierge service, Adaptive Sports NE provides individualized consultation to youth and young adults who have visual or mobility impairments on how to get involved in local leagues, teams and programs. We respond to athletic directors, coaches, parents and athletes. We research the situation and resources available; we provide training to coaches and guides; and we offer ongoing technical assistance as needed. Whether an athlete is just getting started or already a seasoned competitor, Adaptive Sports NE will help identify the best inclusion solution available for each individual.
