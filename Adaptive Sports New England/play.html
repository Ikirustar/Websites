          The Adaptive Sports New England swim team meets weekly and brings
          together competitive swimmers from across the region. Many team
          members also participate on a club or school swim program. The team is
          coached by Paralympic medalists Mike Prout and Anna Johannes who
          design specific programs for each athlete, focusing on technical
          skills and mental preparation. Each swimmer receives an individualized
          program to help work on their technical and psychological skills. This
          program is designed for intermediate and advanced swimmers looking to
          improve their swimming stroke and fitness and takes place weekly at
