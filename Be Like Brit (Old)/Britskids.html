            <h1>A General Sponsorship</h1>
            <p>While many sponsors choose a specific child to support and receive regular updates and information from, our Child Sponsorship program supports all 66 of our children at Brit's Home equally, regardless of official sponsorship status. Rather than identifying a specific child in the child sponsorship process, many individuals prefer instead to give to our general fund. Our general fund offsets the costs associated with programming costs and supports those children who may not be sponsored or who are not fully sponsored. Instead of receiving updates from a specific child, general fund sponsors can watch the whole family grow, learn, and thrive through our social media pages!            </p>

From what we can confirm, his mother died during childbirth when he was just 1 and his father died a year later of yellow fever. When Alexander first arrived, he was shy but playful. He loved to kick around a soccer ball and can get a bit aggressive during a friendly game! He has been going to school since he came to Be Like Brit </p>

As you may know, this dynamic duo has been with Len and Cherylann since they first found the land on which to build Brit’s Orphanage. The children were living outside, sleeping on the ground at a local mission after the earthquake. Christ-Love’s charm and winning smile immediately captured the hearts of Len and the crew who first broke ground on the property. Christ-Love brings us much joy and laughter and is very precious to us!                </p>

                <p class="britkid-description--1">Daffecat is a little girl with a great big personality! She has such a sense of humor and makes all the children and staff members at Brit’s Home burst out into laughter regularly! Daffecat is so loving and sweet, but a handful! When she first arrived, she was happiest when she sat with her doll with the other girls and did their hair –she loves to dance, and she likes to kick a soccer ball around, too! She’s thinks that she’s bigger than she is, and we just love that confidence and spunk!                 </p>

                <p class="britkid-description--1">Dalandya came to Be Like Brit after we learned that she was living with extended family in deplorable conditions and often missed school to do work at home. After speaking to the Director at her school, we learned that Dalandya is especially bright and speaks French almost fluently –a rarity for children who only learn French in school!                </p>
                <p class="britkid-description--2">Dalandya is one of the most confident girls at Brit’s Home. She is a great leader and role-model for the younger girls!

                <img class="brit-kid" src="Images/Daphney.jpg" alt="A photo of Daphney">
                <p class="britkid-description--1">We felt very strongly about bringing Daphney home to BLB after learning that her father deserted the family before her birth, and her mother was so poor she was not able to provide any education or schooling for this sweet girl. She is also half-sister to another Be Like Brit child, Saradina. As we believe strongly in keeping siblings together wherever possible, it was decided that Daphney would come home with us!                </p>
                <p class="britkid-description--2">Daphney plays well with the other children and helps around the house whenever she gets the chance. She keeps a watchful eye on her younger brothers and sisters and says she is most excited about being able to go to school! Daphney is doing quite well in school and helps the younger children as often as she can. She is a very talented young lady and is a natural performer during the Friday night variety shows! She loves dancing, singing and often is the MC for the show! She really enjoys trips to Port-au-Prince, playing educational games, and making up dance routines with her friends.

                <p class="britkid-description--q">Darlandyna is a very sweet little girl who came to us from deplorable conditions in the mountain community nearby Brit’s Home.

                <p class="britkid-description--2">Darlandyna is one of the younger girls at Brit’s Home, but her personality would make you think she is one of the teenage girls.
