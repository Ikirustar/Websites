          Henri Becquerel was studying the effects of light on uranium salts. He
          placed uranium salts on a photographic plate wrapped in black paper.
          Despite the lack of sunlight due to overcast weather, he uncovered an
          image of a copper Maltes on top of the plate. This showed that uranium
          salts were emitting radiation, in which Marie Curie was intrigued by.

          Using that experiment as a thesis, she began work with tons of pitch
          blend to find the new element. Marie for many years would try to
          separate solids from the element and the pitch blend. She would mix
          acids with the pitch blend and through filtering, separate the solids
          and the element. It took 4 years for her to hone in it.

          CHemical analysis confirmed that they discovered a new element. This
          ended up being one of the most dangerous, which they ended up calling
          radium. This discovery got used for energy production, scientific
          research, and even big projects like them Manhattan project. Pierre
          Curie put radium on his arm and discovered that radium was strong
          enough to kill cancer cells. This lead to a breakthrough of medicine
          that makes cancer treatable.
