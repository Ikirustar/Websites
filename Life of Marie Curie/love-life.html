          Pierre Curie Initially gave up on love. He believed romance would
          interrupt work. However, when he met Marie, he begged her to stay in
          Paris to marry him. They both shared their love for science and they
          embarked on it together. Pierre was more joyful than Marie. Marie had
          a seriousness about her, and Pierre's attitude sort of complimented
          that. Marie had a difficult childhood, and having Pierre alleviated
          that.
