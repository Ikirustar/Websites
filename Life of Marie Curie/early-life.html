          Marie Curie grew up in poland, but ended up moving to Paris. Women
          were not allowed to go to university at poland, so she thought Paris
          would give her that opportunity. In Paris, she was a misfit and felt
          like a foreigner. This was due to the fact that she was surrounded by
          french speaking people.

          In class, she was in fact respected by her classmates and got treated
          fairly well. Despite living in poverty, Marie had a strong desire to
          study science and worked very diligently. Her eating habits were also
          just as intense, living on butter and bread. Radishes was also a huge
          part of her diet.
