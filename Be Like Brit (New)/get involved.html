            <p>
              Here at the Operation Center, or as we call it the ‘OC’ in
              Worcester, we have many different volunteer opportunities. Whether
              you’re looking for ways to volunteer as a family, work/ school
              group or individually we have many opportunities for people of all
              ages to help. The OC is home to all the donations we receive from
              our supporters, we store all the donations in a warehouse until
              they are ready to be packed into hockey bags for upcoming
              Britsionary trips. Volunteer opportunities include, but are not
              limited to, organizing in the warehouse, unpacking donations,
              packing for upcoming Britsionary trips, inventory of donations,
              inventory of merchandise, office mailings, event prep ect. To
              learn more about volunteering at the OC, or to schedule a

            <h2 class="subheading">Tribute Gifts</h2>
            <p>
              You can honor a special person or a special event with a gift to
              Be Like Brit. When you make a donation in honor of someone, an
              acknowledgment will be sent to that person listing your name and
              address as a tribute gift donor. It will not list the amount of
              your donation, unless you specify otherwise. If you are
              celebrating a special occasion, you can also list Be Like Brit as
              your charitable organization and ask that in lieu of gifts,
              donations made be made to BLB. This is a wonderful way to help
              support the efforts of Be Like Brit and at the same time spreading
              the word about the great work we are doing. Call or email Melissa
              at 508-886-4500 or Melissa@BeLikeBrit.org

              organizations. Some employers will even double or triple your
